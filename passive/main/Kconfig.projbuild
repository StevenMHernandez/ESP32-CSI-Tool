    config WIFI_CHANNEL
        int "WiFi Channel"
        default 6
        help
            Select the WiFi channel to listen to passively. In North America, valid channels are {1,2,3,...,10,11}.

    config SHOULD_COLLECT_CSI
        bool "Should this ESP32 collect and print CSI data?"
        default "y"
        help
            Allowing only a single ESP32 to collect CSI will likely increase the sampling frequency of your experiments.

    config SHOULD_COLLECT_ONLY_LLTF
        depends on SHOULD_COLLECT_CSI
        bool "(Advanced users only) Should we only collect LLTF?"
        default "y"
        help
            Each CSI frame can contain CSI either calculated through
            (1) legacy long training field (LLTF),
            (2) high throughput LTF (HT-LTF) and/or
            (3) space-time block code HT-LTF (STBC-HT-LTF).
            However, not all CSI frames have HT-LTF or STBC-HT-LTF while all CSI frame have LLTF.
            For beginners collecting only LLTF is the best option while advanced users can handle issues such as
            (1) HT-LTF or STBC-HT-LTF being missing, and
            (2) possible decreases in sampling rate due to serial connection saturation.
            [Advanced Users]: I cannot always help with these advanced issues,
            but if you have ideas on improvements to these issues please share!

    config PRINT_METADATA
        bool "Should CSI metadata be printed?"
        default "y"
        help
            Sending data through serial (to a computer) can take time and buffer space.
            We can reduce the amount of data passed over serial by not printing the metadata.
            However some metadata may be necessary depending on your use case.

    config PRINT_CSI_AS_HEX
        bool "(Advanced users only) Should CSI data be printed in Hexadecimal format?"
        default "n"
        help
            Sending data through serial (to a computer) can take time and buffer space.
            By setting this variable to true, we can reduce the number of characters printed over serial by:
            (1) removing delimiters
            (2) reduce number of character required to exactly 2 for each raw csi value.

    config SEND_CSI_TO_SERIAL
        depends on SHOULD_COLLECT_CSI
        bool "Send CSI data to Serial"
        default "y"
        help
            Sending data through serial (to a computer) can take time and buffer space.
            If you are storing to an SD card, it may be useful to deselect this option.

    config SEND_CSI_TO_SD
        depends on SHOULD_COLLECT_CSI
        bool "Send CSI data to SD"
        default "n"
        help
            Sending data to an SD card can take time and buffer space.
            If your ESP32 does not have an SD card, there is no reason to use this feature.
            If you do though, the program will be recognize this and not attempt writing to the SD card.
